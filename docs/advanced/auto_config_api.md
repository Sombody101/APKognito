### Exclude

exclude <target> [targets ...]
```

    When used within the `assets` stage, it will exclude _entries_ inside valid asset archive files, not the archive files themselves.

??? example

    ```asm
    exclude "/smali/com/somecompany/LoggerUtil/" ; This will exclude the directory from being renamed.
    ```
