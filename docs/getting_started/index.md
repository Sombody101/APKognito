# Getting Started with APKognito

If you haven't already, please make sure to download and install APKognito. You can find a quick guide in [Installing APKognito](./installing.md).

### Step 1: Navigating Windows SmartScreen

When you first run APKognito, Windows will likely display a security warning. This is called [Windows SmartScreen](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/operating-system-security/virus-and-threat-protection/microsoft-defender-smartscreen/).

!!! tip "About SmartScreen"

    SmartScreen is a common warning for new **Free and Open-Source Software (FOSS)**. If you don't trust the app, it's always best to follow your gut and **do not run it**. Your security is important!

    I make sure to attach a link to Virus Total with every release, so you can use that to assist your judgement.

After clicking `More info` and `Run anyway`, APKognito will launch...

!!! tip "Batch Processing"

    APKognito is able to rename more than one package at once. You can select multiple files to process them in a batch.

### Step 3: Configuring and Starting the Process

At this point, you can adjust any [configurations](../configurations.md) to your liking, or simply proceed with the defaults.

By default, your output package name will be `{prefix}.apkognito.{app name}`.

Now, you're ready to start the renaming process. Click the **`Start Renaming`** button.

!!! tip

    Click the _big green button_ that says "Start Renaming" to start the renaming process.

### Step 4: Viewing the Output

All renamed packages are saved to the configured output directory, which defaults to `%APPDATA%\APKognito\output`.

Clicking the **`View Output`** button will open File Explorer directly to this location.
