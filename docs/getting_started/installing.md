### Understanding Version Types

APKognito uses specific prefixes to indicate the type of build you are using. This is important because **APKognito will only update to builds of the same type**.

!!! info "Version Prefixes"

    | Prefix | Type | Description |
    | :--- | :--- | :--- |
    | `v` | **Public Release** | The standard, stable version. Updates are automatic and frequent. (e.g., `v2.0.0`) |
    | `pd` | **Public Debug** | A build containing tools for diagnosing specific user issues. These are provided on a case-by-case basis and will eventually be rolled into a Public Release. |
    | `d` | **Debug** | A local build only obtainable by compiling the source code yourself. These builds never receive updates since the version is constant, and full debug builds are never uploaded. (e.g., `d1.0.0`) |

!!! warning "Important Note"

    If you are using a **Public Debug** build, you will not receive updates for **Public Release** versions, and vice versa. Your version type will only update to a newer build of the same type.

For more technical details on versioning, you can view the source file on GitHub: `AssemblyInfo.Version.cs`.
