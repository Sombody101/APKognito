# Build

`APKognito` was built with [.Net Core 8.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0). Ensure you have the SDK for it prior to trying to build.

If you have Visual Studio installed, you can build it with that.

If you don't have Visual Studio but still have the .Net SDK, you can build it from
Powershell with this command:

```ps
$ cd $path_to_apkognito_source

```
