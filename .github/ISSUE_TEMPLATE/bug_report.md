## Describe the bug
*A clear and concise description of what the bug is.*

## ***Attach the logpack file!***
To get a logpack, go to `Settings > Debugging > Create Logpack`, then attach the ZIP file to your issue.
   Pasting the content of any log boxes is redundant as their content is already in the logpack! Save us both some time and don't paste it!

If you encounter an error while creating the logpack, attach the log files instead. The logs file should be at `%APPDATA%\applog.log` and `%APPDATA%\exlog.log`. You can enter `%APPDATA%` in the search bar of File Explorer and drag the files directly onto your browser page to attach them.

## **Desktop (please complete the following information):**
 - OS: [e.g. Windows 10, Windows 11]
 - Browser [e.g. chrome, safari, firefox]
 - APKognito Version [e.g. 1.5.1.1]
